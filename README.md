# About me

I am a 20 year old computer science major with an interest in software development and system administration

I have knowledge in Java, Javascript, Kotlin, C++ and I am a little rusty in Lua, python and PHP.

I run a homelab hosting many of my projects using hardware from the hosting company I ran in high school.
