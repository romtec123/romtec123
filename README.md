# Why hello there âœŒ

Welcome to my github page!

# About me

I am a 19 year old computer science major with interest in Discord and Minecraft bots. 

I have decent knowledge in Java, Javascript, Kotlin, C++, Python and am a little rusty in Lua and PHP.

In the future I would like to look more into AI, docker containers and Cyber Security.
